                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p> Cats & Coffee is a fictional website made for a 3rd year class, IAT 339:  Web Design and Development, dedicated to promoting their mission in providing a safe environment for rescued cats. Cats & Coffee also offers services such as applications to adopt a cat and purchasing coffee beans. Through this project, I got to use my web-design skills and using HTML5 and CSS3  implement my designs into a responsive web interface. I also learned how to use Git as a way to share and collaborate on code with my partner, as well as keeping our code in a repository as backup.

                <h2>Site Concept & Style Guide</h2>
                <p>For this project, I needed to come up with a concept for a website. I came up with the concept of a website for a Cat Cafe and I made a style guide that would be applied to the design of the website. The style guide includes visual design elements such as the color scheme and typography, how the navigation bar is designed, how the product listings are designed, and the design of the logo!</p>

                <h2>Wireframing</h2>
                <p>I sketched out low-fidelity wireframes for pages of the website and my sketches provided the blueprint for the layout design of the website. Based on the sketches, my partner and I started to implement this layout into code.</p>

                <h2>Coding Process</h2>
                <p>The next step of this project was to use HTML and CSS to create a responsive website, using Visual Studio Code as our text editor. Since the design and layout of the pages are consistent, we were able to use the same code with most of the pages with only minor touch-ups that are unique to each page. This practice made it easier for me to build the other pages of our website.</p>

                <h2>Website Responsiveness</h2>
                <p>One of my roles in this project was making the website responsive on different devices. I achieved this through the use of both grids and flexbox!</p>

                <h2>Challenges</h2>
                <p>I had prior experience with HTML and CSS but never had the time to get a good grasp on it before. However, thanks to our instructorâ€™s great tutorials and <a href="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS Tricks</a>, I was able to quickly learn how to properly make our website responsive! Another challenge me and my partner faced was using Git, since this was a tool that is new to the both of us, but after getting a better understanding on how Git works, this became a very convenient tool for us to use to collaborate on this project. </p>

            <section class="project-section">
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>In creating this website, I gained confidence with the basics of web development, learned how to semantically set up our HTML files, and even make use of ARIA labels to make our website as accessible as possible! After doing this project, I look forward  to exploring further and applying these skills I have learned to create websites for different purposes. In fact, after this project, I was able to use these skills to code my portfolio!</p>
