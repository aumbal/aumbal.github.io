                <p>As one of the UX Researchers, I conducted in-person ethnography, research and interviews. I led our process of designing these cards and used a combination of Figma and Adobe Illustrator to help design our mockups. I led the graphic design of posters, user-jounrey maps and slide decks.

                        </p>
                        <p>The focus of our design project was to enhance Turquoise Goat’s appeal as a destination where people can make personal memories with family and friends, and preserve the unique experience they built together</p>

                        <p>Enrique is a comedian and voice actor who enjoys things like board games, Dungeons and Dragons, and Pokémon. Unlike his friends Haerin and Miho, Enrique is not one to take too many photos to keep as a memory of his outings with friends. He does however, still value the cafe’s unique atmosphere, and would like a token to remember it by. </p>

                <h2>Final concept Proposal</h2>
                <p>Our final design for Turquoise Goat is exclusive Turquoise Goat trading cards that showcase 8 unique card designs that connect together to form a collage that encompasses the different player personas who visit Turquoise Goat. Additionally,  customers will be able to purchase booster packs that contain 5 cards each. In the booster packs there are different colour variants and holographic finishes, which are exclusive to the packs. </p>

                <h2>Visual Design Process</h2>
                <p>As one of the main visual designers in my group, I opted for a vibrant colour palette that reflects Turquoise Goats branding and created a design system within Figma to ensure our group member’s designs remain consistent with one another and cohesive. </p>

                <h2>Rationale</h2>
                <p>The Trading Cards are based off of a myriad of customers that frequent Turquoise Goat. The cards’ characters incorporate fun and quirky characteristics that customers will be able to relate and find commonalities within their party. As well, the card’s characters feature Turquoise Goat’s mascot, Billy the Goat. In addition, The trading cards will enrich the existing Turquoise Goat experience and give customers the incentive to come back to the café, ie. to collect more cards. The cards as well elevates the familiar, 90’s concept of trading card games in a way that fits-in and enriches the cafe’s personality.</p>

                <p>This class has to be my toughest class yet in my academic career. Through this project, I learned so much about working with a real client, navigating team conflicts, communication, project management, and how to design a product that will be produced in the future. It was a great learning experience for me as I got to dive deep into design tools that would be used in the industry for 12 weeks. This project also came with a lot of challenges. Our design process was never linear. We were constantly diverging, converging, killing concepts, and going back to square one from meetings with our stakeholders, and critiques from customers, instructors and classmates. Many decisions were made during this project and we reframed our design focus many times, but it was these decisions and learning more about our users along the way is when we were able to reach our “Aaahh…Eureka!” moment.

                <p>This project was selected to be exhibited at our school’s <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/siat/showcase/spring-2023-project-showcase/explore-the-projects/iat-333-turquoise-goat-trading-cards.html">Spring 2023 Semester showcase online</a> , and I am extremely proud of how I grew as a designer from this project, and I am looking forward to working with more clients in the future.</p>
