                <h2>Lorem ipsum... just kidding</h2>
                <p>My background is in user experience design. I explore solutions to tackle user needs and frustrations, use communication design/illustration for visual storytelling and strive for accessibility and inclusivity. I love to experiment with different styles and learn new software to discover different lenses of design. 
                <br>
                <br>    
                I’m currently pursuing my undergraduate degree at the School of Interactive Arts and Technology at Simon Fraser University with a concentration in Design. I currently work at <a href="https://the-peak.ca/">The Peak SFU</a> as a freelance illustrator. I previously worked at <a href="https://ubccpd.ca/">UBC CPD</a> as an interactive designer where I worked on designing and developing online learning modules for physicians in Canada.
                <br>
                <br>
                I am proficient in illustration tools such as Adobe Illustrator, and prototyping tools such as Figma, as well as in front-end development with HTML/CSS.
                <br>
                <br>
                When I’m not designing, you can find me at local hot pot restaurants, playing Animal Crossing, posting isometric illustrations on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ulyssmei/">instagram</a>, and watching ducks swim!
