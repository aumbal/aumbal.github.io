                <p>While my two disciplines may seem different, I enjoy exploring the intersection of illustration and design as a way to enhance the products and ideas of the companies or clients I work with. It is important that I learn from diverse disciplines to broaden my perspective when addressing various problems and opportunities. I value crafting visually compelling experiences, as I believe that beautiful designs can leverage a narrative a brand, business, or even a game has to convey to its audience.

                <br>    
                I’m pursuing my undergraduate degree at the School of Interactive Arts and Technology at Simon Fraser University with a concentration in Design. I currently work at <a href="https://the-peak.ca/" target="_blank">The Peak SFU</a> as an illustrator and I previously worked at <a href="https://ubccpd.ca/" target="_blank">UBC CPD</a> as an interactive designer where I worked on designing and developing online learning modules for physicians in Canada. You can see many of my illustrations published on their <a href="https://elearning.ubccpd.ca/" target="_blank">eLearning website</a>! I am also involved in creating an indie game titled Lost Radiance, alongside my close colleagues where I took on the role of a UI and concept artist. I am responsible for designing in-game menus, 2D assets, and various graphical interface elements.

                When it comes to drawing, illustrating surreal worlds are my bread and butter. I enjoy immersing people in whimsical environments that evoke feelings of calm and wonder. As of recently, I have been working on an art collection called Elko and the Odd Birds, which features a large bird named Elko living in a world full of fluffy trees and abstract swirls with his tiny round bird-like companions. When looking at this collection, you might find yourself wondering "Who are these weird little fellas 👀".
