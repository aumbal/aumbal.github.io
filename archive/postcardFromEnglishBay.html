                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>As part of a 4-person group, I created a video poetry montage for a poem called “Postcard from English Bay” by Alex Leslie. In collaboration with poets from the City Poems Contest hosted by award-winning poet and current Vancouver Poet Laureate, Fiona Lam, the project was made for our senior media arts class, IAT 344: Moving Images. I took on the roles of art direction, cinematography, and storyboarding.

                <h2>Synopsis</h2>
                <p>This film is about a journey of extreme realism through English Bay. The narrative and subject changes every few seconds and although unpredictable, slowly builds into a cohesive story. It may or may not make sense but it will be clear what’s going on. This is what Vancouver is like. The poet expresses their desire to create a full tableau of what Vancouver is like for those that have lived here for a very long time. A city associated with drug abuse and gentrification. It is not the paradise outsiders think it is, and through the poem, Alex Leslie captures the absurdity of such claims by making Vancouver something far more hyperbolic.</p>

                <h2>Art Direction</h2>
                <p>The poem focuses on scenery and events around English Bay, and how the activities contribute to the development of that area. Reading the poem, I would describe as chaotic and obscure. As someone who has never been to English Bay prior to this film I did not understand what the lines of the poem meant, as the environment is described in a very exaggerated way. Those who live in English Bay will complete understand the hyperbole being described, where as people who do not, have this surreal image from the scenery being described. My goal for the art direction of this poem, I essentially wanted to visually recreate this chaos - an acid trip. The structure would alternate between high paced energy to more calmer, more psychedelic sections.</p>

                <h2>Study from Precedents</h2>
                <p>As one of the main art directors, I wanted to learn from precedent material in trying to achieve the vision my team and I had for the film. Some of the main inspirations I sought out was a Japanese animation called, Bocchi the Rock, and American artist Lauren Tsai.</p>

                <h3>Precedent Annotations</h3>
                <ul class="process-lists">
                    <li>Bocchi the Rock: This Japanese animation series has an absurd animation style compared to other anime. For gag scenes, it shifts art and animation style to sell its comedy. For example, scenes that switch to a 3D rendering UI software to show to try to show the stiffness of the main character who has social anxiety. There are also scenes where you see the character drawn in an abstract matter, to exhibit the chaos that goes in her head.</li>

                <ul class="process-lists">
                    <li>Lauren Tsai: Her artwork is what I also describe as an acid trip, or better yet, a fever dream. She does a lot of surreal art work, mixing medias such as film, 2D animation, and 3D animation all in one montage. Her style is more on the creepy side of things, which captures the surreal imagery that she portrays in her art.</li>

                <h2>Video Treatment</h2>
                <p>To guide our to our intended direction, I annotated each line of the poem, and interpreting what would be happening in each scene. My goal was to try to not be too literal, as the goal is to create a chaotic representation of English Bay. Which each annotation and analysis of each line, I included images from our moldboard to help up initially visualize the direction we want to take each shot.</p>

                <p>To translate our vision into a form we as a group could refer to when we reach the stage to start producing, I was in charge of the storyboard to translate our ideas into sketches and create a visual guide for when we were ready to film. These are some of the shots I have illustrated, which come from how we intend to treat each scene for each line of the poem.</p>

                <h2>Cinematography</h2>
                <p>To translate these drawings into footage, I was one of the main cinematographers in this project. Some of the shots I produced were shots with the black ink, anything related to the seagulls, whip pan shots, and footage of the cars. I also created sprites of what I like to call “little humans” which are used for the toilet scene depicting the line (inset line). I created these using Adobe Illustrator. My main inspiration for these “little humans” are from Lauren Tsai, and wanted to give more of a surreal feel, giving it that fever dream imagery but keeping it quirky and funny due to the form of these humanoid characters.</p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>As a UX Designer and Illustrator, this was a project that is very different from the work I normally do. However, it was a very fun project to embark on, and I felt like I was able to translate some of my skills from illustration into this project. I feel I have a very strong illustration background, so being able to communicate how shots would look like and connect with each other through storyboarding really helped my group on days we were filming. I am looking forward to whatever film project I get to be a part of in the future as I am confident I am able to provide a lot of insight when it comes to pre-production of a film. </p>
