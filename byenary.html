                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>Bye-nary is an interactive narrative mobile application that utilizes game mechanic elements to create a journey for the user into discovering more about 2SLGBTQIA+ terms, vignettes of the experiences of non-binary and trans people in Vancouver, and discover local non-binary/trans businesses and spaces. This project was developed for a 3rd year design course, IAT 334: Interface Design

                <p>This project was open ended, therefore we got to choose which domain we wanted to explore. Our group wants to have a better understanding of the experiences in queer peopleâ€™s lives, and create opportunities for them to take initiative in their health and wellbeing

                <h2>Research Methodology</h2>
                <p>One of my main roles in this project is <strong>UX Researcher</strong>. My research methodology consisted of both primary and secondary research. For my primary research methodology, <strong>I conducted 6 interviews via Zoom with queer individuals -  3 bisexual people (one of whom identifies as nonbinary as well), 2 gay men, and 1 trans femme.</strong> For my secondary research methodology, I sought out academic journals and documentaries for quantitative data to understand the scope of the issues that queer people face in modern society

                <h3>Interactive Systems and Interface Concepts</h3>
                <p>Coming together as a group, we brainstormed 3 concepts of interfaces that have the potential to create a solution for the issues we discovered: <strong>reflective application, educational application, and/or a review application.</strong> Our group decided for that we will explore possibilities for interactivity and solutions under our first concept, the <strong>reflective application.</strong></p>

                <h3>Initial Wireframes</h3>
                <p>Some of the features within our first exploration includes journaling activities like the <strong>I am</strong> activity and answering personal questions on the <strong>memos page</strong></p>

                <h3>Issues. . .</h3>
                <p>There were many issues with the features of our initial wireframes. Some of the feedback pointed out the <strong>lack of connection between our approach and the problem we wanted to address.</strong></p>
                <figure>

                <h3>What did we do?</h3>
                <p>So what did we do? This was part of the design process where my group and I <strong>felt like we hit a roadblock.</strong> To over come this obstacle, I suggested we need to we revisit our findings to figure out what we need to do next. We thought we could move forward with trying to make the initial features work, but it requires complex education research that we did not have the time or resources to commit to. <strong>We decided to take a crack at whats possible with the other two concepts: educational application and review application.</strong></p>

                <h3>Framing Our Design Approach</h3>
                <p>Using the insights we gained from our research, we decided to focus on non-binary and trans people within the queer community, and as a team proposed the question:</p>

                <h2>Challenges with UI Development</h2>
                <h3>Home Page</h3>
                <p>The first iteration included buttons that the user can click and can lead them to activities. Due to how the information is presented, user testing showed that users were not really interested in clicking them. So, the final iteration included progress bars for the user to see their journey on activities and give them clear information on what these activities entail.
                </p>

                </figure>

                <h3>Explore Story</h3>
                <p>Explore Story was one of the main features in this application that I designed, but it was also the feature that went under the most iteration. Initially, I designed it in a way where the user clicks on pre-defined questions  and more information based on that question appears. During user testing, users found this interaction boring, and repetitive, and felt like a lot of the information is only obtained by clicking on those questions.
                </p>
                <p>To solve this issue, I designed an activity similar to visual novels. This solution gives the interface a more interesting layout, and information about the local business is more accessible. The user can scroll and read through the story, and throughout they can select questions to ask about local business, and even submit their own questions, which Ami responds to.
                </p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>This was one of the largest UX/UI projects I have embarked on during my academic career here at Simon Fraser University, and it is one of the projects I am most proud of. Throughout my career as a student, I felt like I lacked research skills. I was always someone who preferred making things look aesthetically pleasing. However, I wanted to gain a new skill from this course, so I chose to focus and challenge myself to take on that UX Researcher role.  I am proud of the research I have done and the methods I chose. Whenever my group and I felt like we ran into a problem, we always referred back to our research and data to help us keep our focus. As a result, not only did I produce a project I am proud of, this project was selected to be presented at our <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/fcat/news/events/ugc-2023.html">facultyâ€™s undergraduate conference in 2023</a>.
                </p>
                <p>Overall, I feel very fulfilled being able to create a fun product that could be potentially be used by those who want to discover more about the non-binary/trans community in Vancouver.</p>
