                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>The Peak SFU, a weekly newspaper created by students at Simon Fraser University, asked me to illustrate the cover for their next serious issue, Communities of Care.</p>
                <p>This is a well-written piece by one of the founders of the no cops on campus initiative. Itâ€™s found support among <a href="https://www.sfusoca.ca/" target="_blank">SFU Students of Caribbean and African Ancestry (SOCA)</a>, <a href="https://sfufnsa.ca/" target="_blank">SFU First Nations Student Association (FNMISA)</a>, and a few other equity groups. Among other topics, it mentions that this does not point to a police-free future, but rather one in which communities support one another through mutual aid and support tactics, rather than surveillance and control.</p>

                <h2>Considerations</h2>
                <ul class="process-lists">
                    <li>Focus on diversity and inclusivity when illustrating people</li>
                    <li>Don't use explicit images of cops and police violence, as it may be triggering and sensitive to those viewing it</li>

                <h2>Illustration Concept</h2>
                <ul class="process-lists">
                    <li>A representative community of people in a display of support in an outdoor setting</li>
                    <li>Inclusion of BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and people of color), gender, 2SLGBTQIA+, and body sizes</li>
                    <li>Opted for <a href="https://kurzgesagt.org/about/" target="_blank">Kurzgesagt-esque</a> flat illustration style and wide range of colors for a more playful look to contrast the seriousness of the written piece</li>

                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Feedback I received from the first iteration is that there is no person who was representing the Indigenous community. Another piece of feedback I received is that it would be better to represent a character with black natural hair (curly/afro), since the piece talks about black and brown people.</p>
                <p>Drawing the Indigenous character was definitely a challenge for me, as it was a community I am not a part of, so there was a lot of unfamiliarity. This made me realize that I needed to learn more about this community and their culture before attempting to draw them as I wanted to avoid amalgamating all the Indigenous nations. A source I did my research on was <a href="https://indigenouspeoplesatlasofcanada.ca/article/clothing/" target="_blank">Indigenous Peoples of Atlas Canada</a>,  which provided examples on Inuit clothing as well as the background behind it.</p>
                <p>Upon receiving this feedback, I thought about other ways to make other characters other than those two mentioned better represent a community they are in, and create more diversity and inclusion within my illustration. I came to the decision to add a character with a hijab, which are head coverings for Muslim women, and a character wearing a qipao, a Chinese dress worn by women. I also illustrated one of the characters to be gender ambiguous, as a way to represent the non-binary community.</p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>Illustrating a cover for this topic has made me reflect on this topic more and made me realize that there are lots of things I still do not know, but there is still room for learning and getting to know different cultures and communities around me. It was an enlightening experience and I am grateful that The Peak SFU has reached out to me to create this cover. I would say that this is one of my favourite illustration pieces I have done as it allowed me to step further into illustrating more diverse characters and  inclusion, which is extremely important nowadays.</p>
